## A Ludum Dare 35 compo game

Unifinished game for LD35. (April 2016). I don't really have the time to use the extra 24hours of the Jam so I submit to the compo.

The theme whas "Shapeshift". I thought about a space ship that transform into a mech to shoot on it's enemies. 

I'm happy about the "shift" animation, and a I learnt a few thing about Unity. (I'm also happy about the 3rd person camera that works quite well, thank you linear interpolation xD)

This repo contains a .gitignore found somewhere on the web to discard files from Unity itself. It should open fine.

This game is under the WTFPL, see COPYING file.
